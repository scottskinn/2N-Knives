            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my world of precision and passion at 2N Knives!<br/>

                I am a dedicated knife maker, pouring my heart and soul into crafting exceptional knives that are a true
                testament to the artistry of the blade. With meticulous attention to detail, I create each knife with a
                perfect blend of traditional craftsmanship and modern design. <br/>

                Step into a realm of excellence and discover the exceptional qualities that define my knives!<br/>

            </p>

			<h2>Materials</h2>
			<p>
				In my knife-making process, I meticulously select and work with exceptional materials to craft high-quality blades. One of the primary materials I employ is high carbon steel, ie: 1095, 80CRV2, 52100 and more, renowned for its remarkable strength, durability, and edge retention. This type of steel allows me to create blades that exhibit excellent cutting performance and maintain their sharpness over time. Additionally, I take great pride in incorporating a variety of hard woods that I have personally collected. These carefully chosen woods not only add an exquisite aesthetic appeal to the handles of my knives but also provide a natural warmth and durability. Each piece of wood tells its own story, infused into the design of the knife, creating a harmonious blend of craftsmanship and nature's beauty
